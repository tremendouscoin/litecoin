What is Tremendouscoin?
----------------

Tremendouscoin will start as an *anti-Trump* cryptocurrency/altcoin. The plan is to mostly give it away, in small amounts like 1 coin to any person claiming to be anti-Trump, and in much larger rewards, like 1,000+ coins, (probably unsolicited), to anti-Trump persons who have recently done notable (but legal) things to help stymie, enrage, thwart, obstruct etc. Trump. It may eventually gain value, but who knows?

What's with the name?
----------------

According to yourdictionary.com, "Tremendous" is Trump's 17th most (over)used word.

By using the name Tremendouscoin rather than actually incorporating the so-called 45th U.S. President's name, Tremendouscoin is also poised to actually well *outlive* the hopefully brief Trump era, as a general left-leaning, or at least non-right-leaning, coin.

Does it suck because it's not technically innovative yet?
----------------

Technically, Tremendouscoin, at least early versions, may be very NON-innovative -- a self-avowed *"shitcoin"*, depending on how you define shitcoin...

However, this coin may serve as an example of a technically un-innovative, but *socially or politically relevant*, cryptocurrency gaining success.

Useful as a clear-cut Tremendouscoin Clone Template? (and also Safe-ish and Trustworthy-ish)
----------------

Tremendouscoin will use a more recent codebase (version 0.1.0 is based on Tremendouscoin 0.14) than many shitcoins (many use Tremendouscoin 0.8 etc).
 
Its modification from the original Tremendouscoin codebase will also strive to be extremely well-documented.
 
For example we will fork right from litecoin-project/litecoin so that anyone can perform easy comparisons with litecoin right on github. This may lead to a modicum of *trust/safety* in the compiled code since anyone will be able to follow clearly how the code was modified from a well-known coin. It may also lead to being a well-known *Tremendouscoin forking example* for others working on creating Tremendouscoin forks to follow (and contribute to!)

Reality check
----------------

##### UPDATE as of 23/Jan/2018 - Early Success!
Today's cleaned-up code *will* compile into

* working tremendouscoin-qt wallet on my macOs Sierra Mac laptop
* working tremendouscoin-qt wallet on my Windows 10 pc laptop
* working tremendouscoind on my AWS Ubuntu server

...the above can connect to each other, and mining into a laptop wallet can be done using a pooling server!!!
(See https://github.com/tremendouscoin/tremendouscoin-pool-server)

##### However, This is by no means a real coin at the moment. The blockchain may be re-started several times before we say "WE'LL DO IT LIVE! FUCK IT!"

Feel free to keep track of this project or to offer to help!

Version 0.1.0 Motto
-------
*"Tremendouscoin ... It's already worth more than Trump's word!"*


Technical instructions
-------
Want to compile from source, etc.?

In general, follow the patterns in the [Litecoin docs](doc) which have been modified as far as syntax but not substance to be Tremendouscoin-specific.

However in addition we will have a few substantially specific [Tremendouscoin-specific docs](doc-tremendouscoin).
